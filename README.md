### Basic Linear Regression Model

In this section, we implement a basic linear regression model from scratch without using any built-in machine learning libraries. The key steps include:

1. **Mathematical Foundation**: Modeling the linear relationship between input features and the target variable.
2. **Optimization Using Gradient Descent**: Minimizing the error between predictions and actual values using gradient descent.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using the R-squared score.
4. **Visualization**: Visualizing the model's performance using Matplotlib.

### Advanced Linear Regression Model

This section covers the advanced version of linear regression, incorporating Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and regularization techniques. The key topics include:

1. **SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)**: An optimization method that updates model parameters using randomly selected samples or mini-batches.
2. **Regularization**: Techniques to prevent overfitting by penalizing large parameter values, including L2 (Ridge Regression) and L1 (Lasso Regression) regularization.

### Comparison of Regression Techniques

We compare the performance of different regression techniques under various noise levels using R-squared scores. The comparison includes:

1. **Normal Linear Regression**
2. **SGD with Ridge (L2) Regularization**
3. **SGD with Lasso (L1) Regularization**

## Conclusion

By implementing linear regression from scratch, we gain a deeper understanding of its mechanics and the benefits of advanced techniques like SGD and regularization. This foundational knowledge is crucial for more advanced machine learning models.
